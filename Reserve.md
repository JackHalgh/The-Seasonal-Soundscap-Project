Old Sneed Park Nature Reserve is a little oasis of green in the city of Bristol nestled between a busy road and housing estates.

The pond (or lake if you prefer) is ~100 years old and was restored in 2008 by local Friends of Old Sneed Park volunteers.

Excess sediment was removed, and some trees were coppiced to let more light in. 

Thanks to the efforts of local volunteers, the land (which also encompasses woodlands and meadows) was officially designated as a Local Nature Reserve on the 22nd of May 2020! 

What secrets does this newly designated nature reserve hold?
