Join me on a journey of gorgeous nature, local history & bizarre underwater sounds as I follow a year in the life of a pond in Bristol, UK.  

Much like an ornithologist can identify bird species by listening to their calls in a woodland, it's possible to listen to the different sounds made by aquatic insects, fish, amphibians & even aquatic plants in a pond to infer biological activity and richness.

### Old Sneed Park Nature Reserve 

The pond in question, Old Sneed Park Pond, is located in a little oasis of green space in the city (Bristol, UK) nestled between a busy road and housing estates. 

The pond (or lake if you prefer) is ~100 years old and was restored in 2008 by local Friends of Old Sneed Park volunteers. 

Excess sediment was removed, and some trees were coppiced to let more light in. 

Thanks to the efforts of local volunteers, the land (which also encompasses woodlands and meadows) was officially designated as a Local Nature Reserve on the 22nd of May 2020! 

What secrets does this newly designated nature reserve hold?
