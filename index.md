## Welcome to The Seasonal Soundscape Project!

Join me on a journey of gorgeous nature, local history & bizarre underwater sounds as I follow a year in the life of a pond in Bristol, UK.

I'm recording the underwater sounds in Old Sneed Park pond in Bristol (UK) once a month using a variety of hydrophones (underwater microphones, pictured below). 

Ponds are packed full of all kinds of bizarre popping & scratching sounds!

Much like an ornithologist can identify bird species by listening to their calls in a woodland, it's possible to listen to the different sounds made by aquatic insects, fish, amphibians & even aquatic plants underwater in a pond to infer biological activity and richness.
